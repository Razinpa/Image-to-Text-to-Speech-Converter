# Image-to-Text-to-Speech-Converter

   The project focuses on building a web application for image processing using Python. The project is about recognizing and taking the texts from any Image or posters and translating them into different languages
and then converting that text into voice. By using this project we can create and hear the audio file of texts in an image, This is done using Pytesseract which is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool for python. It will read and recognize the text in images, license plates, etc. Here tesseract package is used to read the text from the image.
   GoogleTrans is used for the translation of the extracted text to different languages. Python provides many APIs to convert text to speech ,The Google Text to Speech API which  is popular and commonly known as the gTTS API is used here. It is very easy to use the tool and provides many built-in functions which used to save the text file as an mp3 file. The gTTS API supports several languages including English, Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and many more.

Tools Used:
 •	Python
 •	Pytesseract
 •	gTTS API 
 •	Flask
 •	Google Trans
